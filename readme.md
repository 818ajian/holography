## Description

Feel free to use this dirty little code for your own experiments
I put demos on my twitter somtimes  https://twitter.com/AlexandreDevaux

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* ThreeJS, TensorFlowJS


## Help

One thing to be careful about is not to frame too close the subject you want to make a hologram of. The camera frame is smaller than what your screen shows. (A good todo would be to show camera frame while in AR)
