# Holography

Simple demo of WebXR and Deep Learning using Tensorflow to create holograms on-the-fly

## Description

Feel free to use this dirty little code for your own experiments

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* ThreeJS, TensorFlowJS


## Help

One thing to be careful about is not to frame too close the subject you want to make a hologram of. The frame is smaller than what your screen shows
